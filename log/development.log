The new connection handling does not support `connection_handlers`
getter and setter.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using legacy connection handling is deprecated. Please set
`legacy_connection_handling` to `false` in your application.

The new connection handling does not support `connection_handlers`
getter and setter.
